## Reflection

### Challenges Faced

I didn't face any difficult challenges this week.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned

I learned the basics of node.js, how it works and how to use it to make small javascript programs that can be run in terminal.

### Online Resources

chatgpt - Explain the basics of Scrum

youtube - Explain the basics of node.js and npm

### Soft Skills Development

Communication was essential to work with my group. We made good plans for the project and can start the prototyping very soon. Team collaboration was top notch due to us being good friends with eachother.

### Final Thoughts

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the [Web Course] and [Project Course]. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

### Next Steps

The main thing I want to focus on next week is the finalization of our project prototype.
