## Reflection

### Challenges Faced

I didn't face any difficulties this week. Hoping to keep it that way for the rest of the period.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned

All of the class activities went well. I was able to accomplish the goals set by the activities and I'm proud of myself and the progress I'm making.

- Key Learning:

This week I continued my studies in React and Express. I gained more knowledge in Express app execution order.

- Online Resources:

The most useful online resource was the homework videos on YouTube. Thanks to them I was able to accomplish all of the class activities in a hastely manner.
Other than YouTube, I also used Google to find more information about the weekly subjects.
I used ChatGPT to ask about JavaScript formating style.

### Coping Strategies

- Academic Progress:

The most fun class activity was on Nov 7th, Project pair programming activity. The activity itself was fun, but I was unfortunately a bit shy talking to a new person that I hadn't talked to before.

- Soft Skills Development:

My groups project planning took a huge leap forward, and we are starting to have a solid plan on how to move forward. I'mm becoming more confident in my communication skills.

### Project Management

We had good communication throughout the project planning sessions we had in-between classes.

### Final Thoughts

This week has been the most fun so far. I'm really proud of my work in both the Web Development and Web Project courses. I faced every challenge head-on and made myself proud of how I'm improving.

### Next Steps

Now my main focus will be on finishing Sprint 2.
