## Reflection

### Challenges Faced

I didn't face any difficulties this week.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned

All of the class activities went well. I was able to accomplish most of the goals set by the activities and I'm proud of myself and the progress I'm making.

- Key Learning:

This week I learned how to use MongoDB and Mongoose using JavaScript

- Online Resources:

The most useful online resource was the homework videos on YouTube. Thanks to them I was able to accomplish all of the class activities in a hastely manner.
Other than YouTube, I also used Google to find more information about the weekly subjects.

### Project Management

We had good communication throughout the project planning sessions we had in-between classes.

### Final Thoughts

This week has been the most fun so far. I'm really proud of my work in both the Web Development and Web Project courses. I faced every challenge head-on and made myself proud of how I'm improving.

### Next Steps

My main focus will be on finishing Sprint 2, and to start implementing the backend side of our project.
