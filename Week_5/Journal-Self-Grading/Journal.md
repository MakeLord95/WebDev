## Reflection

### Challenges Faced

I didn't face any difficulties. I'm hoping to keep it that way during the entire period. :)

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned

I think that all of the class activities went well. I was able to accomplish all of them and I am proud of the progress I'm making.

- Key Learning:

I learned how to hash and salt passwords for safe database storage. I also learned how to implement MongoDB usage using Mongoose

- Online Resources:

Google, YouTube, ChatGPT.

### Coping Strategies

- Academic Progress:

I was able to complete all class activities without any problems.

- Soft Skills Development:

We had good communication on our project planning. I was unfortunately a bit late to the planning session, but I was able to accomplish the task I was assigned.

### Final Thoughts

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the Web Course and Project Course. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

### Next Steps

Now my main focus is on Sprint 3
