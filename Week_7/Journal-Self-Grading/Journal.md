## Reflection

### Challenges Faced

I was unable to attend classes this week, since I've been sick.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned

Our project took a big leap forward this week.

- Key Learning:

I learned about useReducer and useContect. I also went back and studied more about authorization, bearer tokens and role based access.

- Online Resources:

Google, YouTube, ChatGPT.

### Final Thoughts

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the Web Course and Project Course. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

### Next Steps

Now my main focus is on finishing our project.
